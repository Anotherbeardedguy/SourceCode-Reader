# C# File Combiner and Separator

## Description

This project contains two Python scripts designed to work with C# files. The first script combines multiple C# files from a directory into a single text file, including the file path and custom tags. The second script does the reverse, taking a specially formatted text file and recreating the original C# files in their directories.
